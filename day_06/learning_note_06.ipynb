    "- Fish has a number that is the days to count down to give a birth to one baby fish.\n",
    "- Newborn baby fish starts count down from 8, i.e. they give a birth to one in 8 days.\n",
    "- After that, they will repeat giving a birth to a new lantern fish in 7 days (when they give a birth to a new fish, their number is 0, next day, their number is 6).\n",
    "- Fish found at initial state will give a birth when their count is 0.\n",

    "### Approach (I was thinking about first)\n",
    "1. Sort and group fish into the same age group: in the example case, [4],[3,3],[2],[1]\n",
    "2. Fish existing at initial state will give a birth to a new baby fish `truncate((80-x)/7)` times.\n",
    "3. For each new generation, 1) calculate how many days to go, and 2) calculate how many times they could give a birth to a new baby fish. \n",
